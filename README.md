# SQL Food Inventory â€“ Khan Academy Project

This beginner-level SQL project was built as part of my learning journey on Khan Academy.  
I created a food inventory system using basic SQL operations:

- `CREATE TABLE` for defining schema  
- `INSERT INTO` for adding 15+ food items  
- `SELECT`, `ORDER BY`, and `SUM()` for querying and analyzing data  

ðŸ“Š **Project Goal:** Understand database design and basic SQL queries through a relatable example.
